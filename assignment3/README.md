# 📁 Assignment 3 – Predicting Fast-Growing Firms

This repository contains the full code and documentation for **Assignment 3** of the course *Prediction with Machine Learning for Economists*.

## 📉 Task Overview

The task is to build models to predict fast-growing firms using the **Bisnode firm-level panel data (2010–2015)**.  
We define high growth as a firm with at least a 20% increase in turnover between 2012 and 2013, following the OECD definition.  
Three models are developed and compared: **Logit (M5 and LASSO), Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR)**.  
The analysis includes probability prediction, optimal classification, expected loss evaluation, and a sector-specific comparison (manufacturing vs. services).
